///Sure, here's an example of a .spec file for the ERC4626 contract using Certora Verification Language (CVL). This example checks some basic properties of the contract and functions:

//```solidity
methods {
    function balanceOf(address)         external returns(uint) envfree;
    function allowance(address,address) external returns(uint) envfree;
    function totalSupply()              external returns(uint) envfree;
    function decimals()                 external returns(uint) envfree;
    function totalAssets()              external returns(uint) envfree;
    function convertToShares(uint)      external returns(uint) envfree;
    function convertToAssets(uint)      external returns(uint) envfree;
    function maxDeposit(address)        external returns(uint) envfree;
    function maxMint(address)           external returns(uint) envfree;
    function maxWithdraw(address)      external returns(uint) envfree;
    function maxRedeem(address)         external returns(uint) envfree;
    function deposit(uint,address)      external returns(uint) envfree;
    function mint(uint,address)        external returns(uint) envfree;
    function withdraw(uint,address,address) external returns(uint) envfree;
    function redeem(uint,address,address) external returns(uint) envfree;
    function _convertToShares(uint,Math.Rounding) external returns(uint) envfree;
    function _convertToAssets(uint,Math.Rounding) external returns(uint) envfree;
    function _decimalsOffset()          external returns(uint) envfree;
}
