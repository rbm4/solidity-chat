///Sure, here's an example of a .spec file for the ERC4626 contract using Certora Verification Language (CVL). This example checks some basic properties of the contract and functions:

```solidity
// Imports and contract definition
// ...

// Specification file
spec {
    // Basic properties
    start {
        @const _underlyingDecimals <= 18; // Underlying asset decimals cannot exceed 18
        @const totalSupply == 0; // Initial supply is zero
        @const totalAssets == 0; // Initial total assets is zero
    }

    // Deposit restrictions
    deposit(caller: address, receiver: address, assets: uint256, shares: uint256) {
        pre {
            shares < type(uint256).max; // shares cannot exceed max uint256 value
            caller != address(0); // caller cannot be the null address
            receiver != address(0); // receiver cannot be the null address
        }

        // Check maximum deposit limit
        post {
            @if (maxDeposit(receiver) == type(uint256).max) {
                assets <= maxDeposit(receiver);
            } else {
                assets <= maxDeposit(receiver) && shares == previewDeposit(assets);
            }

            // Check emitted events
            @assert Deposit(caller, receiver, assets, shares);
        }
    }

        }
    }

    // Withdrawal restrictions
    withdraw(caller: address, receiver: address, owner: address, assets: uint256, shares: uint256) {

            caller != address(0); // caller cannot be the null address
            receiver != address(0); // receiver cannot be the null address
            owner != address(0); // owner cannot be the null address

            // Check owner balance
            @if (balanceOf(owner) >= assets) {

            }

            // Check sender approval if not the owner
            if (caller != owner) {
                @assert _spendAllowance(owner, caller, shares);
            }
        }

        post {
